This repository demonstrates a subtle HTML bug involving the use of innerHTML with a non-existent element. The code attempts to update the content of an element that does not exist in the DOM, resulting in a silent failure. This type of bug can be hard to debug as it doesn't produce an obvious error message. The solution file demonstrates the correct way to handle this by first checking for the existence of the element before attempting to modify its content.
